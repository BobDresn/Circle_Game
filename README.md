Simple Circle Game
==================

My first game project with a low level language like Rust
---------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for taking a look at my game! It is very simple, you press space to start and normal keyboard movement.
I want to add on in the future to add a GUI and on screen timer, with a highscore and leaderboard. Eventually I hope to learn networking and add a multiplayer option to it as well.
